# Dataverse integration pattern

## Introduction

Microsoft Dataverse, being a versatile platform, supports various integration patterns catering to different scenarios. Choosing the right integration pattern is essential for a successful implementation, and this article highlights different integration patterns available for syncing data to dataverse.

## Integration patterns

Different integration patterns that can be used while integrating with Dataverse :

- Real-time/synchronous integration
- Near real-time/asynchronous integration
- Batch integration
- Presentation layer integration

### Real-time/synchronous integration

Real-time integration patterns involve immediate data processing, making them suitable for scenarios where instantaneous updates are critical. In the context of Dataverse, this could be achieved through synchronous API calls or direct integration with real-time processing components.

The various technology options available for real-time integration includes:

- Dataverse Web API
- Custom Dataverse API
- Connectors

### Near real-time/asynchronous integration

The near real-time pattern balances responsiveness and efficiency. By leveraging asynchronous processing and events, data is synced with minimal latency. Dataverse's event-driven architecture allows for the implementation of near real-time integration, ensuring timely updates while not compromising on system performance.

The various technology options available for asynchronous Integration includes:

- Azure Service Bus
- Webhooks
- Custom connectors based on Logic Apps

### Batch Integration

For scenarios where processing large volumes of data is more efficient, batch integration is a go-to pattern. Scheduled processes can be set up to handle data in chunks, minimizing the impact on system resources. Dataverse supports batch processing, allowing for the seamless integration of substantial data sets.

The various technology options available for batch integration includes:

- Azure Data Factory
- Power Query Dataflow
- Azure Logic Apps
- Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse

### Presentation layer integration

In certain cases, integrating at the presentation layer provides a streamlined approach. This involves integrating data directly into the user interface, enhancing user experience and ensuring data consistency. Dataverse's capabilities support this pattern, enabling seamless presentation layer integration.

The various technology options for presentation layer integration includes:

- Power Apps component framework (PCF)
- Custom Pages
- Power BI tiles
- Power BI embedded dashboard

## Conclusion

Each integration pattern comes with its unique set of strengths and weaknesses. Selecting the appropriate pattern holds significant sway over the performance and efficiency of integrated systems. Whether it's real-time, near real-time, batch, or presentation layer integration, Dataverse provides a robust platform for seamless data integration across diverse scenarios.
